Just an intuition I had about understanding Binary Search Trees (BSTs): if you parse the name as "(binary search) tree" instead of "binary (search tree)" or anything
else, it makes you realise all a BST is, is a binary tree representing all possible search paths in a binary search of the elements in the BST.

So it's a "binary search" tree.
