This is a post to list interesting sounding potential projects for a 
Raspberry Pi.

1.  [Waterproof, portable time-lapse photography setup](http://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-timelapse-camera-using-Raspberry-Pi-and-a-c/).
    
    Requires:
    + Camera module or webcam
    + Running from battery pack
    + Maybe some attempt to minimise power consumption
    
    Variation on this idea: [Night-vision wildlife camera](http://www.rs-online.com/designspark/electronics/eng/blog/nocturnal-wildlife-watching-with-pi-noir).
    Very cool! Quite a lot of work involved.

2.  Run Haskell on it.

    The main difficulty with this is how long it will take to compile anything
    , especially if using `cabal`, and apparently it's easy to run out of
    memory doing this.
    Alternatively, it might be possible to get a `ghc` cross compiler working,
    but this probably won't be simple.

3.  [Light alarm clock](http://www.instructables.com/id/WeggUp-A-sleeping-cycle-and-light-alarm-clocke/)
    
    This is a very cool project, and would be very useful for people who can't
    get up in the morning, like me! I don't have the woodworking skills 
    necessary for this as it is done here, but maybe using something like 
    [this Ikea light](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/10096375/)
    as the enclosure might be feasible.
    
4.  Run [RetroPie](http://blog.petrockblock.com/retropie/) on it.

    This one is just a matter of time. I don't think I can resist doing this
    one. The only thing it will need is some time and a 
    [Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver](http://www.amazon.it/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?__mk_it_IT=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Xbox+360+Wireless+Gaming+Receiver+) so I can use the Xbox
    wireless controllers I already have. The receiver should cost at most â‚¬15.
    
5.  Make a Pi powered digital photo frame. Something like 
    [this one](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/)
    but costing less, hopefully. This would allow all sorts of things, like
    automatically showing photos from [Flickr](flickr.com), or videos, or
    anything!
    
6.  Apparently, you can use a Kinect with linux now, and this is even possible
    on the Pi! No idea what I would actually do with it, but as I already have
    a Kinect, this is tempting to play around with just because it doesn't 
    need any expenditure.

See [this Reddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/2cw47l/unofficial_what_canshould_i_do_with_a_pi_help/)
for some more ideas.
