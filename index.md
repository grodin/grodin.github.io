![My smiling face!](/img/portrait.png)
I am currently an indie [Android](developer.android.com/) developer, with one app released (link to
come). I plan to find a job somewhere instead of being independent soon.

I am also interested in [Haskell](www.haskell.org), and functional programming
in general.

This blog will also feature stuff that I've done or plan to do with my
[Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org/).
