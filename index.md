I am currently an indie [Android][1] developer, with one app released (link to
come). I plan to find a job somewhere instead of being independent soon.

I am also interested in [Haskell][2], and functional programming
in general.

This blog will also feature stuff that I've done or plan to do with my
[Raspberry Pi][3].
