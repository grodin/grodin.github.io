Hi, I'm Joseph Cooper. I've been programming as a hobby for over 30 years and recently 
decided I'd like to try doing it as a job. I'm interested in Kotlin, Rust, Linux and who knows what else. 
I'm going to try to write about those things,
as well as notes for myself about things I've learned, especially when I've had to learn it
several times for lack of writing it down the first time!

Apart from techy things, I enjoy cycling (mostly off-road these days), hill walking and spending time with my family.

No doubt I'll write a post about how I built this blog soon, as that seems to be par for the course with devblogs.

Why the name "onemanbaboon"? Because I misread the name of the blog [One Man Doom][onemandoom] one day as "One Man Baboon",
liked the sound of and bought the domain. Not the best reason, nor the worst, but at least it's a reason!
